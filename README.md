# YelpCamp

Currently hosted on [Heroku - here](https://yelpcamp-wdb.herokuapp.com/)

This project is from [Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy. This project is a Full Stack Web app built using MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS. I hope to introduce React in the future.

__This website is for learning purposes only.__ This website is website similar to Yelp and AirBnB. Users are able to post their campsites, advertise, rate, and comment on different campsites.
